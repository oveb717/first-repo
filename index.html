    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[To be able to secure your website optimally we as a company would recommend:

        Using an advanced password for every login, example; Must be: Capital letter, number and special sign.
        
        Using an authorisation and authentication service such as Onelogin for logins which provides extra security for the users. Using a third party verification service validates the user so that everyone can be sure who is using the account.
        
        Suggest using automated user timeout so that in case a user forgets to log out, they minimize the risk of other people suddenly finding themselves on their user.
        
        If you want to use third party applications integrated in your website, you would be wise to use well known applications to make sure it is not a scam. A simple way to ensure everything is ok is to check how popular the application is. Simply check how many downloads it has. And a simple review search on a search engine to check. 
        
        Sanitization of data is highly recommended. This means that you make sure that the data that you want to delete, really gets deleted. In some cases there can be traces of what youâ€™re deleting left. This can be done manually or by using third party solutions. ]</p>
